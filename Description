In this project, we have designed and developed a Rock Paper Scissor game
using Tkinter, random module, and the basics of Python. Rock Paper Scissor is
a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player
simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These
shapes are “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”. A player who chooses rock will
win by another player who chooses scissors but lose by the player who chooses
paper; a player with paper will lose by the player with the scissors. If both
players choose the same then the game is tied. In this python project, players
have to choose any one from rock, paper, and scissors and the game will thus
be played.
